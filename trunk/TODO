Bugs:
	rewrite_host causes things to never cache (fixed?)
		
Todo:
	Prevent request pileup
	Properly refetch pages that time out
	Increase default request timeout
	Add reconnect code to memcache library
	Cache dependencies for cached pages so they don't get scanned on every request
	syntax for either purging or mark dirty
